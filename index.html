            <p>Johnny Cash (b. 1932) began as an archetypal country singer with short-lived mainstream success. His true
                modern popularity is largely in part
                due to the collaboration with Rick Rubin and the gritty and bare American Recordings from the 90s. Armed
                with just a guitar and his deep bass
                tones, Johnny Cash created a whole new genre of modern country and removing any hint of cheesiness.

            <p>Leonard Cohen (b. 1934 d. 2016) was a true renaissance man; singing, composing poetry, writing and being ordained as a Zen Monk. From the very start of his musical career his songs were filled with a large dose of melancholy and introspective wandering. He had the ability to write timeless classics for the masses like Hallelujah whilst keeping his poetic and artistic credibility intact.    </p>

            <p>Sixto Rodriguez (b. 1942) is a cult icon in modern music. Releasing fantastic folk music in the 70s to very little notice, he left the music scene and continued work in construction. Little did he know that his music had become a national sensation in South Africa and his popularity was booming. After a film revisited his career in 2012, he has finally achieved the recognition he deserves.</p>

            <p>Bob Dylan (b. 1941) is possibly the most revered musician of all time. A single greatest hits album wouldn't come close to recording the timeless additions he has made to both folk and popular music. An icon of the 60s, he has constantly refused to be labelled and rebelled against anybody who has tried. The icing on the cake was winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016.</p>
